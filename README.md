# Selected Topics in Computer Programming  
A set of algorithmic exercises given in a Computer Science class by Prof. Vinicius Gusm√£o (http://vigusmao.github.io/) at UFRJ, Brazil and other interesting exercises found on the internet.

These exercises are separated by folder and on each folder there is an explanation of how they were solved and a set of solutions.

These problems were solved randomly in C, Python or Javascript. Don't ask me why.
