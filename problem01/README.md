Problem 01: find square triangular numbers.

Eg.: 36=6\*6 e 36=1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8. 

Program: find n first square triangular numbers.

1st solution was implemented using sqrt() and it takes around 19 seg to find 13 results.

2nd solution was implemented using a tip from Prof. Vinicius takes around 10.5 to find 13 results.

3rd solution uses a recurrence function of a Square Traingular number and it takes around 0.00023 seg to find 13 results and has complexity O(n).
